This is a point to remember that upto now we have seen sorting 
algorithms with time complexity of O(n^2)

These Bubble sort, insertion sort and selectionsort does
not work well with large data sets and are highly time consuming therefore to reduce 
time comlexity from quadratic to logarithmic we will use certain techniques that consume 
more memory as compared to selection bubble and insertion sort but are very fast 
and can be scalled very easily with large data sets
