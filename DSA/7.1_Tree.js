// A tree is a data structure that follows a parent child relationship in its node.
// A tree is a non linear data structure that means we can have multiple paths in tree
// A tree can have more than one child but there should not be any cyclic connection among all the nodes

// The top node of tree is called Root of a tree

// A node which is directly connected to another node moving away from root is called a child
// Parent is something that is really oppsoite to a child. 

// Siblings are a group of nodes pointing towards same parent.

// A node without any child is called leaf

// The connection between two nodes is called an edge


// USE case
// HTML DOM is a good example of tree
// Artificial intelligence (AI)
// Network Routing 
// Folder Structure in an Operating Systems


// BINARY TREE ---> A tree having at most two childs is called a binary tree
// BINARY SEARCH TREE ---> It is a special binary tree in which the nodes on left of root will have value less than the root node and node on the right side of the root will have values greater than the root node.
