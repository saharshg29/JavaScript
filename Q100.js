// 2341. Maximum Number of Pairs in Array
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:

// Choose two integers in nums that are equal.
// numsove both integers from nums, forming a pair.
// The operation is done on nums as many times as possible.

// Return a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.
