To print all the Subseqences use parameterized recursion -------------> 17.js

To Print all the subseqences whose sum is k use parameterized recursion-----------------> 18.js
for this we just just need to carry one varSum in our parameters and calculate it 
In brute force approach we will check for all the subseqence if the total sum is k if true then print subseqence else return from base case

To Print any 1 subseqence whose sum is k we need to use functional recursion ----------------> 19.js
Function will return true if a subseqence with given sum k is found and further recursion calls will be avoided

To print the count of all subseqences having the given sum k we will be using functional recursion --------------> 20.js
Function will return 1 if base condition is matched or it will return 0 if base condition is not matched 
and at last it will return sum of all function calls
